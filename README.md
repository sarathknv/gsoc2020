# GSoC 2020 Final Code Submission

## Weekly Progress  

- Community Bonding + Week 1
  - Developed a POC for non-rigid image registration using the MNIST dataset. Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fTzz1aT2sb8oAXRO1-dr6O_IR6dof36e?usp=sharing 
  - Made a pull request for the same. Link: https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/2137
  - Cleaned the code and refashioned the dipy.nn.registration API
  - Added docstrings and comments.

- Week 2
  - Implemented the VoxelMorph model (CVPR 2018 paper). But yet to be trained.
Implemented and trained 2d and 3d deep learning models for unsupervised affine registration. Similar to AIRNet but trained in an unsupervised fashion like the VoxelMorph model.
